- Use `@ObjectType()` decorator for all GraphQL output types
- Always implement the standard constructor pattern to handle MongoDB documents:
  ```ts
  constructor(input: EntityDocument | EntityObject) {
    Object.assign(this, {
      ...((input as any)._doc
        ? (input as EntityDocument).toObject({ virtuals: true })
        : input),
    });
  }
  ```
- This should expose properties from `<entity>.schema.ts` file, without properties which shouldn't be exposed like password hash, and other which are not needed for client to use, and just for proper handling on backend
- This pattern ensures proper handling of virtual fields like `id` vs `_id`
